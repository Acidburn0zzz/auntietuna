AuntieTuna
==========

AuntieTuna is a Chrome Extension that checks if each visited page is
a potential phishing website based on snapshots of known good websites
that a user adds.

For example, a user adds a snapshot of Bank of FooBar. The extension
then checks every other page the user visits to see if it looks like
Bank of FooBar--if it does, it's likely phish and blocked.

The latest version can be found at https://ant.isi.edu/software/antiphish.
